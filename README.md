BingBot
=======

BingBot is a simple script with GUI that automates the earning of points for Bing Rewards. I tried to make this program very simple so that any person can pick it up and instantly use it without having to know a lot about Bing Rewards.

## Features
* Allows for up to 5 accounts at a time (not Facebook accounts)

* Detects how many points needed for both mobile searching and desktop searching
* Earns the "Earn and Explore" points
* Variable search delay that can be changed in the code
* Searches for web, images, and videos for desktop searching (image and video searches don't register for points on mobile for some reason)
* Emulates an iPhone to obtain mobile searches
* A ~6000 word list that contains many commonly searched for items and is still being updated by me
* A word list class that actually searches various places for these commonly searched for items (not used in GUI)
